# Dynamic search

Takes a search string from the client's input and matches it against a txt document containing data: including emails. If matched, the data is displayed using AJAX technique while maintaining the ascending order of domain names and emails. E.g. a@aa.co.uk, b@aa.co.uk, a@bb.co.uk, b@bb.co.uk. The data is also split into pages.
